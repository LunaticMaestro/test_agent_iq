# Plan For questions:

- What new products or services have our top three competitors launched in the past 6 months?
- How are competitors positioning themselves differently in terms of price, quality, or service?
- How sensitive is our sales forecast to potential changes in market conditions or competitor actions?

## Plan 

1. Use a tool to news or latest update on the competitor 
2. Now use the tool to find what kind of information it can provide about our customer data, specifically column names 
3. now prepare a question based on '1.' and '2.' that our tool answer about our customer demographics if we wish offer what our competitors are offering 
4. Now use the tools to retrieve answer to each of the question prepared in '3.'
5. Collate the answers and respond to the end user.
